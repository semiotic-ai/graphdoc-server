 Your input fields are:
1. `database_schema` (str)

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `documented_schema` (str): The database schema with proper documentation, ensuring that the underlying schema is not altered.

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
{database_schema}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## documented_schema ## ]]
{documented_schema}

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        ### TASK:
        Analyze the provided GraphQL Schema and generate detailed yet concise descriptions for each field within the database tables and enums. 
        
        ### Requirements:
        - Utilize only the verified information from the schema to ensure accuracy.
        - Descriptions should be factual, straightforward, and avoid any speculative language.
        - Refrain from using the phrase "in the { table } table" within your descriptions.
        - Ensure that the documentation adheres to standard schema formatting without modifying the underlying schema structure.
        
        ### Formatting:
        - Maintain consistency with the existing documentation style and structure.
        - Focus on clarity and precision to aid developers and system architects in understanding the schema's components effectively.

 Your input fields are:
1. `database_schema` (str)

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `category` (Literal[perfect, almost perfect, poor but correct, incorrect])
3. `rating` (Literal[4, 3, 2, 1])

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
{database_schema}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## category ## ]]
{category}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: perfect; almost perfect; poor but correct; incorrect

[[ ## rating ## ]]
{rating}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: 4; 3; 2; 1

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        You are a documentation quality evaluator specializing in GraphQL schemas. Your task is to assess the quality of documentation provided for a given database schema. Carefully analyze the schema's descriptions for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Categorize the documentation into one of the following ratings based on your evaluation: 
        - perfect (4): The documentation is comprehensive and leaves no room for ambiguity in understanding the schema and its database content.
        - almost perfect (3): The documentation is clear and mostly free of ambiguity, but there is potential for further improvement.
        - poor but correct (2): The documentation is correct but lacks detail, resulting in some ambiguity. It requires enhancement to be more informative.
        - incorrect (1): The documentation contains errors or misleading information, regardless of any correct segments present. Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.
        Provide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.

 This is an example of the task, though some input or output fields are not supplied.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
filler schema

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## category ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[perfect, almost perfect, poor but correct, incorrect]), then `[[ ## rating ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[4, 3, 2, 1]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.

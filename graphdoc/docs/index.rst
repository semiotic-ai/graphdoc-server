GraphDoc documentation
======================

.. include:: links.rst

`GraphDoc` is a tool for generating GraphQL documentation given a GraphQL schema. It is coupled with tooling for interacting with 
`MLflow <mlflow_>`_ for tracking and logging. At the root of the `graphdoc <graphdoc_repo_>`_ directory, 
you will find a `mlflow-manager <mlflow_manager_>`_ directory that can help you setup and manage a local MLflow server. Within the `graphdoc` directory, you will 
find a `run.sh <run_script_>`_ script that can help you get started with a majority of common workflows that you may want to run. Just reach open an issue, or 
submit a PR, if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks!

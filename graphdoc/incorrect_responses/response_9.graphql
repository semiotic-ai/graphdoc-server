# actual category (incorrect) (1) | predicted category (poor but correct) (2) 
# reasoning: The provided schema describes a GraphQL type named `_Schema_` with two full-text search capabilities: `listedTokenSearch` and
# `editionSearch`. These searches are configured to rank results based on specified fields from the `ListedToken` and `Edition`
# entities, respectively. The fields included in the search are metadata-related, such as `metadataName`, `metadataArtist`, and
# `metadataTagString`, among others. The schema uses directives to specify the search configuration, including the language and
# algorithm. However, the description is minimal and lacks detailed explanations of the purpose and usage of the `_Schema_`
# type, the context in which it is used, and the significance of the fields and entities involved. This lack of comprehensive
# documentation makes it difficult to fully understand the schema's intent and functionality without additional context.

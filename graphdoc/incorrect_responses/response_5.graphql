# reasoning: The documentation for the `TokenEvent` table is quite comprehensive and provides detailed descriptions for each field. It
# includes the type of each field, references to other entities, and explanations of what each field represents. The use of
# terms like "Type: ID!" and "Type: BigInt!" helps clarify the data types, and the descriptions provide context for how each
# field is used within the schema. However, there is a slight inconsistency in the description of the `id` field, where it
# mentions a "composite key made from multiple items," but this is not reflected in the schema itself, which shows `id` as a
# single `ID!` type. This could lead to some confusion. Overall, the documentation is almost perfect but could be improved by
# addressing this inconsistency.

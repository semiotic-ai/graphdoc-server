# reasoning: The documentation for the `Swap` type in the GraphQL schema is quite comprehensive. Each field is accompanied by a
# description that explains its purpose and the context in which it is used. The descriptions provide clarity on the data types
# and the significance of each field, such as `id`, `hash`, `nonce`, `logIndex`, and others. The optional nature of some
# fields, like `gasUsed`, is also noted, which is important for understanding the variability across different blockchain
# implementations. The documentation also specifies relationships with other entities like `protocol`, `account`, `pool`,
# `tokenIn`, and `tokenOut`, which helps in understanding the schema's structure and how different entities interact. However,
# there is a minor ambiguity in the description of `reserveAmounts`, as it does not specify what the array of `BigInt` values
# represents in detail. Despite this, the overall documentation is clear and informative, with only slight room for
# improvement.

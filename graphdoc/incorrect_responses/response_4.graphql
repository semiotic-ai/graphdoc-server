# actual category (poor but correct) (2) | predicted category (almost perfect) (3) 
# reasoning: The documentation for the `CollectionDailySnapshot` type is quite comprehensive and provides clear descriptions for each
# field. The `id` field is explained with a unique identifier format, though it could be more explicit about its components.
# Each field has a brief but clear description, such as `collection`, `blockNumber`, `timestamp`, and various financial metrics
# like `royaltyFee`, `dailyMinSalePrice`, and `dailyMaxSalePrice`. The descriptions are concise and mostly self-explanatory,
# which helps in understanding the purpose of each field. However, some descriptions could be expanded for clarity, such as
# explaining the significance of the `blockNumber` and `timestamp` in the context of a daily snapshot. Overall, the
# documentation is almost perfect but could benefit from slight improvements in detail and clarity.

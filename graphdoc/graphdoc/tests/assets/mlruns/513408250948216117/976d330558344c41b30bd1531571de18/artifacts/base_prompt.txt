 Your input fields are:
1. `database_schema` (str)

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `documented_schema` (str): The database schema with proper documentation, ensuring that the underlying schema is not altered.

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
{database_schema}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## documented_schema ## ]]
{documented_schema}

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        ### TASK:
        Given a GraphQL Schema, generate a precise description for the columns of the tables in the database.
        
        ### Requirements:
        - Focus solely on confirmed details from the provided schema.
        - Keep the description concise and factual.
        - Exclude any speculative or additional commentary.
        - DO NOT return the phrase "in the { table } table" in your description.
        
        ### Formatting
        - Ensure that the schema maintains proper documentation formatting, as is provided.

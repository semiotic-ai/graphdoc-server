# graphdoc
Automating the generation of subgraph documentation through the utilization of Large Language Models.

## Development

We utilize [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Please run `poetry install` to install the dependencies from within the relevant directory (e.g. `graphdoc` or `mlflow-manager`). You can also run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment. Please see the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for more information.

We utilize [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) for commit messages and semantic versioning. Please run `cz commit` to commit your changes. Commitizen can be installed with `pip install commitizen` or `brew install commitizen`.

Here are some quick commands for getting started:

```bash 
brew add poetry
brew add commitizen
```

```bash 
cd graphdoc
poetry install 

cd ../mlflow-manager
poetry install 
```

### run.sh

The `run.sh` script is a convenience script for development. It provides a few shortcuts for running useful commands.

```bash 
# ensure that the script is executable
chmod +x run.sh

# install both packages in development mode
./run.sh dev
```

To setup the mlflow-manager services, run the following command:

```bash 
./run.sh mlflow-setup
```

Below, we provide an overview of the commands available in the `run.sh` script. 

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./run.sh dev` | Install both packages (graphdoc and mlflow-manager) in development mode |
| `./run.sh install` | Install both packages (graphdoc and mlflow-manager) in production mode |
| `./run.sh mlflow-setup` | Setup the mlflow-manager services |
| `./run.sh mlflow-teardown` | Teardown the mlflow-manager services |
| `./run.sh doc-quality-train` | Train a document quality model (using the default config in `graphdoc/assets/configs/single_prompt_doc_quality_trainer.yaml`) |
| `./run.sh build-and-run-doc-quality-trainer` | Build and run the document quality trainer (./run.sh mlflow-setup && ./run.sh doc-quality-train) |

### python 

We utilize `python==3.13.0` for this project. Please see the [python documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more information. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install python.

Below, we include some useful commands for installing python using pyenv.

```bash 
# install pyenv
brew install pyenv

# install python 3.13.0
pyenv install 3.13.0

# set the python version
pyenv local 3.13.0

# check the python version
python --version
```

There is a chance that your system may have python allocated under the name `python3`. If this is the case, the following commands may help resolve the `python` namespace to your `python3` installation.

```bash 
# export the pyenv path
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# reload the shell
source ~/.zshrc

# check the versions
python --version  # Should show 3.13.0
which python  # Should show ~/.pyenv/shims/python
```

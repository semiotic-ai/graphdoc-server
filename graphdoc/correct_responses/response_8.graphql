# reasoning: The schema provides a basic description for the enum type `DisputeStatus` and its possible values: `Undecided`, `Accepted`,
# `Rejected`, and `Draw`. Each value has a description, but the descriptions are minimal and do not provide additional context
# or details about what each status represents or how it is used within the application. While the documentation is correct, it
# lacks depth and could be improved by providing more comprehensive explanations for each status.

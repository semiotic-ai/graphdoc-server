# reasoning: The documentation for the enum type `TransactionType` provides a description for each of its values. However, the
# descriptions are minimal and do not provide any additional context or explanation beyond restating the name of the enum
# value. This makes it difficult to understand the specific meaning or use case for each transaction type. While the
# documentation is not incorrect, it lacks depth and detail, which could lead to ambiguity in interpreting the schema.

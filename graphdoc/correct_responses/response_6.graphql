# reasoning: The documentation for the `Round` type in the schema provides a description for each field, which is a good practice.
# However, there are several issues that affect the clarity and accuracy of the documentation: 1. The description for the `id`
# field is misleading. It states "Unique identifier for each player in hexadecimal," which is incorrect because the `Round`
# type represents a round in the Livepeer protocol, not a player. The `id` should be described as a unique identifier for the
# round. 2. The `startTimestamp` is described as "The ending date depicted by noon UTC," which is contradictory. A timestamp
# should represent the start of the round, not the ending date. 3. The `pools` field is described as "Transactions not
# associated with the round," which is confusing. The `@derivedFrom(field: "round")` directive suggests that these pools are
# indeed associated with the round. 4. The `mintableTokens` field is described as "Fees generated this round in Dogecoin,"
# which is likely incorrect given the context of the Livepeer protocol, which typically deals with Ethereum-based tokens. 5.
# The `volumeETH` and `volumeUSD` fields have descriptions that are swapped. `volumeETH` should measure ETH debits, and
# `volumeUSD` should measure USD debits. 6. The `totalActiveStake`, `totalSupply`, `participationRate`, `movedStake`,
# `newStake`, `inflation`, `numActiveTranscoders`, `activeTranscoderCount`, and `delegatorsCount` fields have descriptions that
# are either unclear or potentially misleading without further context. Overall, while the documentation attempts to provide
# information for each field, there are several inaccuracies and ambiguities that need to be addressed to make the
# documentation clear and correct.

The Livepeer protocol is round based and each round is represented by some number of Ethereum blocks.

# reasoning: The documentation for the `TransferEvent` schema is filled with inaccuracies and misleading descriptions. Many of the field
# descriptions do not align with their likely intended meanings. For example, the `timestamp` is described as "The opposite of
# the date of the event," which is nonsensical. Similarly, `transactionIndex` is described as "The number of times it rained
# during the event," which is irrelevant and incorrect. The descriptions for `eventAddress`, `eventTxFrom`, and `eventTxTo` are
# also misleading and do not provide clarity on their actual purpose. Overall, the documentation is incorrect and does not
# provide a clear understanding of the schema.

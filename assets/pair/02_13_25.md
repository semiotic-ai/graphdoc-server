- [ ] check with artem about how we want to push data in postgres and minio
    - [ ] currently, we have this set up locally in our image, where we don't push things in our image to postgres and minio

- [ ] change this model to be passed in by the name and version number instead of the uri
- [ ] check out having api keys for access 
- [ ] move over to a company account for running this 

- [ ] talk with artem about how we want to pass in the config files to the server

------- artem notes --------
- [ ] do we keep using postgres and minio in our image, or use a gcp service 
    - [ ] gcs: this would be easier to use than minio: can just push things as an artifact store 
    - [ ] CloudSQL: this will be used instead of postgres in the image, as its a managed service 
- [ ] how do we want to pass in config files to the server 
    - [ ] we can just push the config file in the image and push it
    - [ ] if we just want to change the config file instead 
- [ ] should this be on cloud run or gke? 
    - [ ] check how long cloud run will take to spin up (so we don't have users waiting for a long response)
- [ ] API key management (external users): we will try MLFlow Gateway for this, and go with secret manager if not 

-------- denver notes --------
- [ ] split out grapdoc-server into a separate repo
- [ ] put time on ani's calendar for a code review for this 

- [ ] live end of next week (api up and running)
- [ ] check out the ai gateway for api key management (also rate limiting)

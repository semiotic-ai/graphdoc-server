You are evaluating the quality of documentation between two representations of the same schema. One schema will be provided as an example of quality documentation. The other table schema is the one you will be evaluating. 
[BEGIN DATA]
***
[TASK]: The task is to determine the quality of documentation for one table schema, given access only to a table definition and two different documentation implementations. 

The goal is to create informative descriptions which reduces ambiguity and increases understanding for users of the database .

[DOCUMENTATION CRITERION]: Evaluation Criteria

Correctness: 
4: Perfect ( Exceeding the GOLD documentation ):
A perfect column description, and in turn table documentation, should contain enough information so that the interpretation of the column is completely free of ambiguity. It does not need to include any descriptions of the specific values inside the column to be considered perfect. The description should contain information about what table the column is referencing. For example, instead of "The name," we want "The name of the client that made the transaction" if we have a transaction database with columns such as NAME, AMOUNT, and DATE to resolve the ambiguity of what the name refers to. Additionally, the column description should be a full and valid English sentence, with proper grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. For instance, instead of "nationality of drivers" when each instance refers to only one driver, it should be "The nationality of a driver."

3: Almost Perfect ( Matching the GOLD documentation ):
Matching the gold description, but failing to meet the criteria set by perfect column descriptions. The column descriptions are somewhat correct, but there is room for improvement.

2: Somewhat Correct ( Falling below the GOLD documentation )
Column descriptions are somewhat correct, but there is room for improvement due to missing or misleading information. It could still contain correct information, but any incorrect information automatically leads to a somewhat correct rating.

1: Incorrect  ( Invalid based upon the GOLD documentation )
The column descriptions are missing or completely misleading. The documentation not only fails to accurately describe the table and it's columns, it is completely incorrect. An incorrect column clearly has a description that does not align with the column naming.

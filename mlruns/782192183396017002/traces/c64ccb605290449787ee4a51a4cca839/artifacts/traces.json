The use of terms like \\\"cumulative\\\", \\\"daily\\\", \\\"hourly\\\", and \\\"snapshot\\\" is consistent and helps in understanding the temporal aspects of the data being modeled.\\n\\nOverall, the documentation is thorough and leaves little room for ambiguity, making it easy for users to understand the schema and its components.

Each enum type, table, and interface is accompanied by clear and concise descriptions that explain the purpose and function of the fields. The descriptions for the enum types like `Network`, `ProtocolType`, `RewardTokenType`, and `VaultFeeType` are straightforward and provide a good understanding of what each value represents. The tables such as `Token`, `RewardToken`, `VaultFee`, `YieldAggregator`, and others are well-documented, with each field having a description that clarifies its role and data type. The use of annotations like `@entity`, `@regularPolling`, `@dailySnapshot`, and `@hourlySnapshot` further enhances the understanding of the schema's behavior and data handling processes. The schema also includes derived fields and relationships between entities, which are well-explained. Overall, the documentation is detailed and leaves little room for ambiguity, making it easy for developers to understand and work with the schema.\", \"category\": \"perfect\", \"rating\": 4}"}

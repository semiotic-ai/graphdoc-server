Each field in the schema is accompanied by a clear and concise description that explains its purpose and data type. The descriptions provide sufficient context to understand the role of each field within the event. For instance, the `id` is identified as a unique identifier, and the `transaction` is clearly linked to the associated transaction. The `timestamp` is specified as a Unix timestamp, which is a standard way to represent time. The `round`, `delegator`, and `delegate` fields are well-explained, indicating their roles in the event. The `stake` and `fees` fields are described as decimals, which is important for understanding the precision of these values.

Each field has a concise explanation that accurately describes its purpose and the type of data it holds. The use of terms like \\\"Unique identifier,\\\" \\\"Timestamp,\\\" \\\"Block number,\\\" and \\\"Total volume\\\" are clear and provide a good understanding of what each field represents. The descriptions also include the data types, which helps in understanding the kind of values expected. The use of `@derivedFrom` for the `pools` field is well-explained, indicating its relationship with the `Pool` type. Overall, the documentation is detailed and leaves little room for ambiguity.

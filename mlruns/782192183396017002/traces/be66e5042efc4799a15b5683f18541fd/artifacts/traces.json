Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\\\nProvide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\\\"\\n    database_schema = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'input', 'prefix': 'Database Schema:', 'desc': '${database_schema}'})\\n    reasoning = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'prefix': \\\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\\", 'desc': '${reasoning}', '__dspy_field_type': 'output'})\\n    category = Field(annotation=Literal['perfect', 'almost perfect', 'poor but correct', 'incorrect'] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Category:', 'desc': '${category}'})\\n    rating = Field(annotation=Literal[4, 3, 2, 1] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Rating:', 'desc': '${rating}'})\\n)\", \"completion\": \"[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\nThe documentation for the `YieldAggregator` table is quite comprehensive and provides clear descriptions for each field.

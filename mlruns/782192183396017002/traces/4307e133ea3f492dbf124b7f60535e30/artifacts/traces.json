Categorize the documentation into one of the following ratings based on your evaluation: \\\\n- perfect (4): The documentation is comprehensive and leaves no room for ambiguity in understanding the schema and its database content.\\\\n- almost perfect (3): The documentation is clear and mostly free of ambiguity, but there is potential for further improvement.\\\\n- poor but correct (2): The documentation is correct but lacks detail, resulting in some ambiguity. It requires enhancement to be more informative.\\\\n- incorrect (1): The documentation contains errors or misleading information, regardless of any correct segments present.

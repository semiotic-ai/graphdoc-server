Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\\\nProvide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\\\"\\n    database_schema = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'input', 'prefix': 'Database Schema:', 'desc': '${database_schema}'})\\n    reasoning = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'prefix': \\\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\\", 'desc': '${reasoning}', '__dspy_field_type': 'output'})\\n    category = Field(annotation=Literal['perfect', 'almost perfect', 'poor but correct', 'incorrect'] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Category:', 'desc': '${category}'})\\n    rating = Field(annotation=Literal[4, 3, 2, 1] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Rating:', 'desc': '${rating}'})\\n)\", \"completion\": \"[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\nThe documentation for the `FinancialsDailySnapshot` table is quite comprehensive and clear. Each field is accompanied by a description that explains its purpose and data type. The descriptions are concise yet informative, providing a good understanding of what each field represents. The use of terms like \\\"cumulative\\\" and \\\"daily\\\" helps distinguish between different types of data aggregation, which is crucial for financial data analysis. The documentation also specifies the data types, such as `BigDecimal` and `BigInt`, which are important for understanding the precision and scale of the data. The only minor improvement could be to provide more context or examples for how these fields might be used in practice, but this does not detract significantly from the overall quality.

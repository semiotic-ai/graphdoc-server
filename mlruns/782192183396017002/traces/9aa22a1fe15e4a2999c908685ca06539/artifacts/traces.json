Categorize the documentation into one of the following ratings based on your evaluation: \\\\n- perfect (4): The documentation is comprehensive and leaves no room for ambiguity in understanding the schema and its database content.\\\\n- almost perfect (3): The documentation is clear and mostly free of ambiguity, but there is potential for further improvement.\\\\n- poor but correct (2): The documentation is correct but lacks detail, resulting in some ambiguity. It requires enhancement to be more informative.\\\\n- incorrect (1): The documentation contains errors or misleading information, regardless of any correct segments present. Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\\\nProvide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\\\"\\n    database_schema = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'input', 'prefix': 'Database Schema:', 'desc': '${database_schema}'})\\n    reasoning = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'prefix': \\\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\\", 'desc': '${reasoning}', '__dspy_field_type': 'output'})\\n    category = Field(annotation=Literal['perfect', 'almost perfect', 'poor but correct', 'incorrect'] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Category:', 'desc': '${category}'})\\n    rating = Field(annotation=Literal[4, 3, 2, 1] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Rating:', 'desc': '${rating}'})\\n)\", \"completion\": \"[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\nThe documentation for the `Position` table is quite comprehensive. Each field is accompanied by a clear and concise description that explains its purpose and role within the schema. The descriptions cover unique identifiers, associated accounts, liquidity pools, tokens, transaction hashes, block numbers, timestamps, position sides, funding rates, leverage, balances, realized profit and loss, and associated lists of collateral deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations. The use of terms like \\\"Unique identifier,\\\" \\\"Account associated,\\\" \\\"Liquidity pool related,\\\" and \\\"Token used as collateral\\\" provides clarity on the relationships and data types involved. The documentation also includes details about derived fields, which is important for understanding how data is interconnected. However, there is a minor opportunity for improvement in terms of providing examples or additional context for some fields, such as what constitutes a \\\"PositionSide\\\" or how \\\"realisedPnlUSD\\\" is calculated.

Your task is to assess the quality of documentation provided for a given database schema. Carefully analyze the schema's descriptions for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Categorize the documentation into one of the following ratings based on your evaluation: \\n        - perfect (4): The documentation is comprehensive and leaves no room for ambiguity in understanding the schema and its database content.\\n        - almost perfect (3): The documentation is clear and mostly free of ambiguity, but there is potential for further improvement.\\n        - poor but correct (2): The documentation is correct but lacks detail, resulting in some ambiguity. It requires enhancement to be more informative.\\n        - incorrect (1): The documentation contains errors or misleading information, regardless of any correct segments present. Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\n        Provide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[[ ## database_schema ## ]]\\n\\\"Description for table: ActiveAccount\\\"\\ntype ActiveAccount @entity @regularPolling {\\n  \\\"Unique identifier for the active account, represented as a non-nullable byte array.\\\"\\n  id: Bytes!\\n  \\\"List of deposit transactions associated with the account, represented as a non-nullable array of Deposit objects.\\\"\\n  deposits: [Deposit!]!\\n  \\\"List of withdrawal transactions associated with the account, represented as a non-nullable array of Withdraw objects.\\\"\\n  withdraws: [Withdraw!]!\\n}\\n\\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## category ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[perfect, almost perfect, poor but correct, incorrect]), then `[[ ## rating ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[4, 3, 2, 1]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.\"}]"}, "events": []}, {"name": "LM.__call___2", "context": {"span_id": "0x879dff0f4b5bcaa4", "trace_id": "0xaf1d4b57e924bffe43b93f13812b6eb8"}, "parent_id": "0x27a593103084323f", "start_time": 1738953360793476000, "end_time": 1738953360795131000, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"8aed1d7220f741ccb04c9cb23d9a1756\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAT_MODEL\"", "temperature": "0.0", "max_tokens": "1000", "api_key": "\"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\"", "model": "\"openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06\"", "model_type": "\"chat\"", "cache": "true", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your input fields are:\\n1. `database_schema` (str)\\n\\nYour output fields are:\\n1. `reasoning` (str)\\n2. `category` (Literal[perfect, almost perfect, poor but correct, incorrect])\\n3. `rating` (Literal[4, 3, 2, 1])\\n\\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\\n\\n[[ ## database_schema ## ]]\\n{database_schema}\\n\\n[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\n{reasoning}\\n\\n[[ ## category ## ]]\\n{category}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: perfect; almost perfect; poor but correct; incorrect\\n\\n[[ ## rating ## ]]\\n{rating}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: 4; 3; 2; 1\\n\\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\\n\\nIn adhering to this structure, your objective is: \\n        You are a documentation quality evaluator specializing in GraphQL schemas.

Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\\\nProvide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\\\"\\n    database_schema = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'input', 'prefix': 'Database Schema:', 'desc': '${database_schema}'})\\n    reasoning = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'prefix': \\\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\\", 'desc': '${reasoning}', '__dspy_field_type': 'output'})\\n    category = Field(annotation=Literal['perfect', 'almost perfect', 'poor but correct', 'incorrect'] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Category:', 'desc': '${category}'})\\n    rating = Field(annotation=Literal[4, 3, 2, 1] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Rating:', 'desc': '${rating}'})\\n)\", \"completion\": \"[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\nThe documentation for the `BridgeTransfer` table is quite comprehensive. Each field is accompanied by a description that clearly explains its purpose and role within the schema. The descriptions are concise yet informative, providing enough context to understand the data structure and its components. For instance, fields like `id`, `hash`, `logIndex`, and `protocol` are well-defined, indicating their unique roles in identifying and categorizing the bridge transfer event. The use of terms like \\\"source\\\" and \\\"destination\\\" for addresses and chain IDs is consistent, which helps in understanding the directionality of the transfer. Additionally, the documentation covers various aspects of the transfer, such as the involved accounts, tokens, and amounts, including their USD equivalent, which adds to the clarity. The inclusion of fields like `isOutgoing`, `isSwap`, and `crossTransactionID` further enriches the schema by addressing specific scenarios in bridge transfers. Overall, the documentation is clear, detailed, and leaves little room for ambiguity, making it easy for developers to work with this schema.\\n\\n[[ ## category ## ]]\\nperfect\\n\\n[[ ## rating ## ]]\\n4\\n\\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\"}", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"reasoning\": \"The documentation for the `BridgeTransfer` table is quite comprehensive.

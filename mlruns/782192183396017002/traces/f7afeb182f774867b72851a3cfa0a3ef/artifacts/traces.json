Such inaccuracies necessitate an incorrect rating.\\\\nProvide a step-by-step reasoning to support your evaluation, along with the appropriate category label and numerical rating.\\\"\\n    database_schema = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'input', 'prefix': 'Database Schema:', 'desc': '${database_schema}'})\\n    reasoning = Field(annotation=str required=True json_schema_extra={'prefix': \\\"Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\\", 'desc': '${reasoning}', '__dspy_field_type': 'output'})\\n    category = Field(annotation=Literal['perfect', 'almost perfect', 'poor but correct', 'incorrect'] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Category:', 'desc': '${category}'})\\n    rating = Field(annotation=Literal[4, 3, 2, 1] required=True json_schema_extra={'__dspy_field_type': 'output', 'prefix': 'Rating:', 'desc': '${rating}'})\\n)\", \"completion\": \"[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\nThe documentation for the `PositionSnapshot` table is quite comprehensive and provides clear descriptions for each field.

The use of terms like \\\"stored as bytes,\\\" \\\"stored as a big integer,\\\" and \\\"stored as a big decimal\\\" provides clarity on the data types used. The descriptions also include the context of the data, such as \\\"Unique identifier for the position snapshot\\\" and \\\"Cumulative value of deposits in USD,\\\" which helps in understanding the role of each field within the schema.

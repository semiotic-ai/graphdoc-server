This could lead to some ambiguity.\\n\\n4. **maturityBlock**: The description \\\"The block number at which the interest rate matures\\\" is clear, assuming the context of blockchain or similar systems where block numbers are relevant.\\n\\n5. **side**: The description \\\"The side of the interest rate, indicating whether it is a borrowing or lending rate\\\" is clear and informative.\\n\\n6. **type**: The description \\\"The type of interest rate, such as fixed or variable\\\" is clear and provides examples, which is helpful.\\n\\n7. **tranche**: The description \\\"The tranche associated with the interest rate, if applicable\\\" is clear, though it assumes the reader understands what a tranche is.\\n\\nOverall, the documentation is mostly clear and informative, with the main area for improvement being the specification of the unit of time for the `duration` field.

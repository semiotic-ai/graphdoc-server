For instance, the `id` field is clearly identified as a unique identifier, and the `day` field is explained as an integer representing the day for which metrics are recorded. The descriptions for fields like `dailyActiveUsers`, `cumulativeUniqueUsers`, and `dailyTransactionCount` are straightforward and informative, detailing exactly what each metric represents. Additionally, the use of terms like \\\"daily\\\" and \\\"cumulative\\\" helps to distinguish between metrics that are specific to a single day and those that accumulate over time. The inclusion of fields like `timestamp` and `blockNumber` further enhances the schema by providing temporal and blockchain context. Overall, the documentation is well-structured and leaves little room for ambiguity, making it easy for users to understand the schema and its contents.\\n\\n[[ ## category ## ]]\\nperfect\\n\\n[[ ## rating ## ]]\\n4\\n\\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\"}", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"reasoning\": \"The documentation for the `UsageMetricsDailySnapshot` table is quite comprehensive and clear.

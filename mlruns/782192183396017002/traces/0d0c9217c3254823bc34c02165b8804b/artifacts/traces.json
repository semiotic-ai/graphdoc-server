The use of terms like \\\"Unique identifier,\\\" \\\"List of chain identifiers,\\\" and \\\"Total number of\\\" provides a clear understanding of what each field represents. The descriptions also specify the data types, such as `Bytes`, `BigInt`, and `Int`, which helps in understanding the kind of data each field will store. The use of `@derivedFrom` is explained in the context of collections, indicating the relationship between the `Account` and other entities like `BridgeTransfer`, `LiquidityDeposit`, `LiquidityWithdraw`, and `BridgeMessage`.

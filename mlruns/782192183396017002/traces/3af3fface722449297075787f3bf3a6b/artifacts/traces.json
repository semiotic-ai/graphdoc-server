Each field is described with its purpose and context within the borrow event, which helps in understanding the schema. The descriptions cover the unique identifier, transaction details (hash, nonce, logIndex, gasPrice, gasUsed, gasLimit), block information (blockNumber, timestamp), and entities involved (account, accountActor, market, position, asset). Additionally, the financial details such as the amount borrowed and its USD value are well-documented. The use of terms like \\\"Unique identifier,\\\" \\\"Hash of the transaction,\\\" and \\\"Amount of the asset borrowed\\\" are precise and leave little room for ambiguity. The schema also includes data types, which further aids in understanding the expected data format.

The use of `@derivedFrom` for certain fields is also well-documented, indicating the relationship between entities. However, there is a slight lack of detail in explaining the context or use cases for some fields, such as `tickLower`, `tickUpper`, `liquidityToken`, and `liquidityTokenType`, which could be expanded upon for a more complete understanding. Overall, the documentation is clear and mostly free of ambiguity, but there is room for further improvement in providing additional context.\", \"category\": \"almost perfect\", \"rating\": 3}"}, "events": []}], "request": "{\"database_schema\": \"\\\"Description for table: Position\\\"\\ntype Position @entity @regularPolling {\\n  \\\"Description for column: id\\\"\\n  id: Bytes!\\n  \\\"Description for column: account\\\"\\n  account: Account!\\n  \\\"Description for column: pool\\\"\\n  pool: LiquidityPool!\\n  \\\"Description for column: hashOpened\\\"\\n  hashOpened: Bytes!\\n  \\\"Description for column: hashClosed\\\"\\n  hashClosed: Bytes\\n  \\\"Description for column: blockNumberOpened\\\"\\n  blockNumberOpened: BigInt!\\n  \\\"Description for column: timestampOpened\\\"\\n  timestampOpened: BigInt!\\n  \\\"Description for column: blockNumberClosed\\\"\\n  blockNumberClosed: BigInt\\n  \\\"Description for column: timestampClosed\\\"\\n  timestampClosed: BigInt\\n  \\\"Description for column: tickLower\\\"\\n  tickLower: Tick\\n  \\\"Description for column: tickUpper\\\"\\n  tickUpper: Tick\\n  \\\"Description for column: liquidityToken\\\"\\n  liquidityToken: Token\\n  \\\"Description for column: liquidityTokenType\\\"\\n  liquidityTokenType: TokenType\\n  \\\"Description for column: liquidity\\\"\\n  liquidity: BigInt!\\n  \\\"Description for column: liquidityUSD\\\"\\n  liquidityUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Description for column: cumulativeDepositTokenAmounts\\\"\\n  cumulativeDepositTokenAmounts: [BigInt!]!\\n  \\\"Description for column: cumulativeDepositUSD\\\"\\n  cumulativeDepositUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Description for column: cumulativeWithdrawTokenAmounts\\\"\\n  cumulativeWithdrawTokenAmounts: [BigInt!]!\\n  \\\"Description for column: cumulativeWithdrawUSD\\\"\\n  cumulativeWithdrawUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Description for column: cumulativeRewardUSD\\\"\\n  cumulativeRewardUSD: [BigInt!]\\n  \\\"Description for column: depositCount\\\"\\n  depositCount: Int!\\n  \\\"Description for column: deposits\\\"\\n  deposits: [Deposit!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n  \\\"Description for column: withdrawCount\\\"\\n  withdrawCount: Int!\\n  \\\"Description for column: withdraws\\\"\\n  withdraws: [Withdraw!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n  \\\"Description for column: snapshots\\\"\\n  snapshots: [PositionSnapshot!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n}\"}", "response": "{\"documented_schema\": \"\\\"Description for table: Position\\\"\\ntype Position @entity @regularPolling {\\n  \\\"Unique identifier for the position\\\"\\n  id: Bytes!\\n  \\\"Reference to the account associated with the position\\\"\\n  account: Account!\\n  \\\"Reference to the liquidity pool associated with the position\\\"\\n  pool: LiquidityPool!\\n  \\\"Hash value when the position was opened\\\"\\n  hashOpened: Bytes!\\n  \\\"Hash value when the position was closed, if applicable\\\"\\n  hashClosed: Bytes\\n  \\\"Block number when the position was opened\\\"\\n  blockNumberOpened: BigInt!\\n  \\\"Timestamp when the position was opened\\\"\\n  timestampOpened: BigInt!\\n  \\\"Block number when the position was closed, if applicable\\\"\\n  blockNumberClosed: BigInt\\n  \\\"Timestamp when the position was closed, if applicable\\\"\\n  timestampClosed: BigInt\\n  \\\"Lower tick boundary for the position\\\"\\n  tickLower: Tick\\n  \\\"Upper tick boundary for the position\\\"\\n  tickUpper: Tick\\n  \\\"Token representing liquidity in the position\\\"\\n  liquidityToken: Token\\n  \\\"Type of the liquidity token\\\"\\n  liquidityTokenType: TokenType\\n  \\\"Amount of liquidity in the position\\\"\\n  liquidity: BigInt!\\n  \\\"USD value of the liquidity in the position\\\"\\n  liquidityUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Cumulative amounts of deposit tokens\\\"\\n  cumulativeDepositTokenAmounts: [BigInt!]!\\n  \\\"Cumulative USD value of deposits\\\"\\n  cumulativeDepositUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Cumulative amounts of withdrawn tokens\\\"\\n  cumulativeWithdrawTokenAmounts: [BigInt!]!\\n  \\\"Cumulative USD value of withdrawals\\\"\\n  cumulativeWithdrawUSD: BigDecimal!\\n  \\\"Cumulative USD value of rewards\\\"\\n  cumulativeRewardUSD: [BigInt!]\\n  \\\"Number of deposits made\\\"\\n  depositCount: Int!\\n  \\\"List of deposits associated with the position\\\"\\n  deposits: [Deposit!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n  \\\"Number of withdrawals made\\\"\\n  withdrawCount: Int!\\n  \\\"List of withdrawals associated with the position\\\"\\n  withdraws: [Withdraw!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n  \\\"List of snapshots capturing the state of the position over time\\\"\\n  snapshots: [PositionSnapshot!]! @derivedFrom(field: \\\"position\\\")\\n}\"}"}

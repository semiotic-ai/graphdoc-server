The use of terms like \\\"Unique identifier,\\\" \\\"Name,\\\" \\\"Symbol,\\\" and \\\"Total supply\\\" are straightforward and easy to understand. The financial fields such as \\\"Cumulative trade volume in ETH,\\\" \\\"Marketplace revenue in ETH,\\\" \\\"Creator revenue in ETH,\\\" and \\\"Total revenue in ETH\\\" are well-described, indicating the type of data they represent. The field \\\"nftStandard\\\" is also clearly defined, which is crucial for understanding the type of NFTs in the collection. The use of `@derivedFrom` for the `trades` field is a good practice, indicating that this field is derived from another field, which is helpful for understanding relationships within the schema. Overall, the documentation is clear, accurate, and leaves little room for ambiguity, though there is always room for minor improvements or additional context.\", \"category\": \"almost perfect\", \"rating\": 3}"}

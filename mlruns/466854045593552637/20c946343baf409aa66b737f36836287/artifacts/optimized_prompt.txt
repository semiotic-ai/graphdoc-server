 Your input fields are:
1. `database_schema` (str)

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `category` (Literal[perfect, almost perfect, somewhat correct, incorrect])
3. `rating` (Literal[4, 3, 2, 1])

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
{database_schema}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## category ## ]]
{category}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: perfect; almost perfect; somewhat correct; incorrect

[[ ## rating ## ]]
{rating}        # note: the value you produce must be one of: 4; 3; 2; 1

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Analyze the provided GraphQL Schema documentation to assess its clarity and completeness. Consider whether the documentation allows for unambiguous interpretation of the schema and its database content. Based on your analysis, assign one of the following category ratings: "perfect" (4), "almost perfect" (3), "somewhat correct" (2), or "incorrect" (1). Provide a detailed reasoning for your evaluation, explaining your thought process step-by-step, and then output the determined category and numerical rating.

 This is an example of the task, though some input or output fields are not supplied.

[[ ## database_schema ## ]]
filler schema

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## category ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[perfect, almost perfect, somewhat correct, incorrect]), then `[[ ## rating ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal[4, 3, 2, 1]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
